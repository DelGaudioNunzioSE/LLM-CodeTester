I need you to generate a list of input tuples that are valid for two Python functions which solve the same problem.

Example:
Problem Description:
Return the sum of two integers.

Solution1:
```python
def add(a, b):
```

Solution2:
```python
def add(self, x, y):
```

Output:
```python
input_test = [
    (1,2), # simple case
    (0,6), # zero case (edge case)
    (3,-6) # negative case 
]
```


Input:
Problem Description:
{description}

Solution1:
```python
{code}
```

Solution2:
```python
{code2}
```

Output:
